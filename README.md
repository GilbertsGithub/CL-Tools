# CL-Tools - Command Line tools for UNIX style shells. 

## Available scripts

### pushd.pl
Greatly extend push/pop, and even cd, command using perl script. The big wins are the ability to symbolically search the stack using path fragments as well as "rise" entries rather than rotating so popular directories rise to the top of the stack. 

This script shows its perl-4 herriatage.
