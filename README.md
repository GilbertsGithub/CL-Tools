# CL-Tools - Command Line tools for UNIX style shells. 

## Available scripts
1. pushd.pl - greatly extend push/pop, and even cd, command using perl script. The big win is the ability to symbolically search the stack as well as "rise" entries rather than rotating so popular directories rise to the top of the stack. 

  Script goes back to the days of perl-4.
